# Bryt Designs Tech Challenge

### Shopify Quick View Modal (Headless UI Feature)

# Tradeoffs

- I wanted to focus on the product listings and general modal functionality, and as there is not a specific design from a Figma or something like that, I went with a retrowave inspired design, and tried to keep things clean. I also wanted a good separation of concerns, such as the components, utils, and types folders.

# What I'd do more next time

- I'd like to add more from the nice to have list.
